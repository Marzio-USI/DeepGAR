# DeepGAR
Extension of DeepAR that works with graphs.

Using electricity.ipynb one can run the LSTM-STGNN model, one has to specify the number of models to train. One has to specify if testing must be performed or if training must be performed or both. Sometimes checkpoint may break so one has to specify the checpoint callback path of the checpoint model.

Using electricity_v2.ipynb one can run the GRU-STGNN model, one has to specify the number of models to train. One has to specify if testing must be performed or if training must be performed or both. Sometimes checkpoint may break so one has to specify the checpoint callback path of the checpoint model
